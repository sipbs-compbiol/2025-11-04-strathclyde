# 2025-11-04-strathclyde Data Structures and Data Frames instructor notes

## Preflight

1. Ensure that `RStudio`/`R` is open with the appropriate packages installed (`tidyverse`)

----------

## Learning Questions

- This lesson might sound like it's going to be a bit dry: "Why should I care about data types and structures?"

- **IF YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR DATA, AND YOU UNDERSTAND HOW `R` SEES YOUR DATA, YOUR ANALYSIS WILL BE MUCH EASIER AND MORE EFFECTIVE**

- Some questions you might have had before this session may include those on the slide:
  - How can I read data in `R`?
  - What are the basic data types in `R`?
  - How do I represent categorical information in `R`?

- This session aims to help you answer those

----------

## Learning Objectives

- In this section, you'll be learning about the data types in `R`:
  - **WHAT DATA IS**
- You'll be learning about data *structures*:
  - **WHAT DATA IS BUILT INTO - HOW IT IS ARRANGED**
  
- You'll also learn how to find out what type/structure a particular piece of data has
  - Putting it together, you'll see how `R`'s data types and structures relate to the types of data that you work with, yourself.
  - This will help you work much more fluently in `R`

- In particular, we'll be working with **DATA FRAMES** - this is the workhorse data structure in `R` and, when you use `R`, you will see a _lot_ of them.

----------

## Data Types and Structures in `R`

- `R` is **MOSTLY USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS**
- `R` is set up with key, core data types designed to help you work with your own data
- A lot of the time, `R` focuses on tabular data.
- **`R` is very powerful when dealing with tabular data**
  
- **INTERACTIVE DEMO**
- **SWITCH TO THE CONSOLE**

- Let's start by making a toy dataset.
- We'll eventually save this in your `data/` directory, with the name `feline-data.csv`
- Use the console in `RStudio`

- We'll create a new variable called `cats`
  - This holds a `data.frame`

```R
cats <- data.frame(coat = c("calico", "black", "tabby"),
                    weight = c(2.1, 5.0, 3.2),
                    likes_catnip = c(1, 0, 1))
```

- We can now save the content of the variable `cats` as a CSV (comma-separated variable) file.
  - We use the `write.csv()` function
  - It is useful to call argument names explicitly so that the code is more readable

```R
write.csv(cats, file = "data/feline-data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

- We're writing the `cats` data out to file
  - `file` specifies the filename we're writing to
  - `row.names` tells `R` not to give the rows in the table a name

- **USE THE FILES TAB/VIEW FILES TO VIEW THE CONTENTS OF THE NEW FILE**

- This is a plain text file, and you could have created it using a text editor like Nano or Notepad.
  - The first row is the header row
  - Each individual cat gets its own row
  - Each column is a different kind of data
  - Each column is separated by a comma

- We can load the data from a CSV file in a similar way to how we write it
  - We can use the `read.csv()` function
  - Inspect the dataset by using the variable name

```R
cats <- read.csv(file = "data/feline-data.csv")
cats
    coat weight likes_catnip
1 calico    2.1            1
2  black    5.0            0
3  tabby    3.2            1
```

- **THINK ABOUT THE DATA TYPES** Are they all the same?
  - **NO** `coat` is text; `weight` is some real value (in kg or pounds, maybe), and `likes_string` looks like it should be `TRUE`/`FALSE` but is represented as 1s and 0s
  - **DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO WORK WITH EACH OF THESE ELEMENTS OF DATA AS IF THEY'RE THE SAME THING?** (No)

- Let's explore our dataset
- **EXTRACT A COLUMN FROM A TABLE**
  - Use `$` notation in the console
  - **NOTE THE AUTOCOMPLETION**

```R
> cats$weight
[1] 2.1 5.0 3.2
> cats$coat
[1] "calico" "black"  "tabby" 
```

- **WHAT DID `R` RETURN?**
  - A *vector* (1D ordered collection) of numbers or character strings
- **WE CAN OPERATE ON THESE *VECTORS***
  - *Vectors* are an important concept, and `R` is largely built so that operations on vectors are central to data analysis.

- Suppose that we discover the scales used to weigh the cats is miscalibrated
  - Every cat weight is underestimated by 2kg
  - We can correct all the weights at once

```R
> cats$weight + 2
[1] 4.1 7.0 5.2
```

- Suppose we want to make a string out of each of the coat types:

```R
> paste("My cat is", cats$coat)
[1] "My cat is calico" "My cat is black"  "My cat is tabby" 
```

- **What if we try to combine these columns?**

```R
> cats$weight + cats$coat
Error in cats$weight + cats$coat : 
  non-numeric argument to binary operator
```

- **WE HIT AN ERROR**
  - You probably already realised that wasn't going to work, because adding "calico" to "2.1" is nonsense.
    - **You already have intuition about this**
  - **THESE DATA TYPES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE** for addition
  - `R`'s data types reflect the ways in which data is expected to interact

- **UNDERSTANDING HOW YOUR OWN DATA MAP TO `R`'s DATA TYPES IS KEY**
  - It's very important to understand how `R` sees your data (**you want `R` to see your data the same way you do**)
  - Many problems in `R` come down to incompatibilities between data and data types.

----------

## What Data Types Do You Expect?

- **ASK THE STUDENTS**
  - What data types would you expect to see?
  - What data types do you think you would **WANT OR NEED**, from your own experience?
- **SPEND A COUPLE OF MINUTES ON THIS**
  - The difference between a *data type* and a *data structure*

----------

## Data Types in `R`

- `R`'s data *types* are *atomic*: they are **FUNDAMENTAL AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS BUILT UP FROM THEM**, the same way matter is built up from atoms
  - In particular, all the data *structures* are built up from data *types*
- There are only **FIVE DATA TYPES** in `R` (though one is split into two…) - three that matter here and two we won't deal with
  - **logical**: Boolean, True/False (also `1`/`0`)
  - **numeric**: anything that's a number on the number line; two types of number are supported: `integer` and `double` (real)
  - **character**: text data - readable symbols
- The other two are less relevant to you and we'll not deal with them much today
  - **complex**: complex numbers, defined on the 2D plane
  - **raw**: binary data

- **LET'S LEARN A BIT MORE ABOUT THEM IN THE DEMO**

- We can ask what type of data something is with the `typeof()` function

```R
> typeof(cats$weight)
[1] "double"
> typeof(TRUE)
[1] "logical"
> typeof(3.14)
[1] "double"
> typeof(1)
[1] "double"
```

- This might seem unintuitive: `1` is an integer
  - But `R` treats all numbers as `double`s (i.e. "Real" numbers) by default
  - To force `R` to see a value as an integer, we need to add an `L` suffix

```R
> typeof(1L)
[1] "integer"
> typeof(cats$coat)
[1] "character"
> typeof("Irn Bru")
[1] "character"
```

- No matter how complicated your analysis gets, _all_ data in `R` is interpreted as one of these basic data types.
  - `R` - like most computer languages - is strict about data types, and this has important consequences.

- **SUPPOSE OUR FRIEND WANTS TO ADD DETAILS OF THEIR OWN CAT TO OUR DATASET**
  - We can create a new dataframe to hold this data

```R
> additional_cat <- data.frame(coat = "tabby", weight = "2.3 or 2.4", likes_catnip = 1)
> additional_cat
   coat     weight likes_catnip
1 tabby 2.3 or 2.4   
```

- **We can "stack" dataframes using the function `rbind`**

```R
> cats2 <- rbind(cats, additional_cat)
> cats2
    coat     weight likes_catnip
1 calico        2.1            1
2  black          5            0
3  tabby        3.2            1
4  tabby 2.3 or 2.4            1
```

- Initially, everything looks OK - but we've silently caused some problems.
  - Let's look at the data type of `cats$weight` in the two dataframes

```R
> typeof(cats$weight)
[1] "double"
> typeof(cats2$weight)
[1] "character"
```

- Our friend gave us a different data type in the `weight` column, and this means we can no longer do the same weight adjustment (adding on 2kg) that we did before:

```R
> cats2$weight + 2
Error in cats2$weight + 2 : non-numeric argument to binary operator
```

----------

## A Quick Note About Dataframes

- Any column in a dataframe can contain only one datatype.
- Initially, the datatype of `cats$weight` was `double`
- When we added the new cat, the data in that column was `character` - i.e. a string
- Because we can always represent a number as a string, but we can't always represent a string as a number, `R` chose to _coerce_ the datatype from `double` to `character` for that column.

- **INTERACTIVE DEMO**
- We can look at the structure of a dataframe using the `str()` function

```R
> str(cats)
'data.frame': 3 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ coat        : chr  "calico" "black" "tabby"
 $ weight      : num  2.1 5 3.2
 $ likes_catnip: int  1 0 1
> str(cats2)
'data.frame': 4 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ coat        : chr  "calico" "black" "tabby" "tabby"
 $ weight      : chr  "2.1" "5" "3.2" "2.3 or 2.4"
 $ likes_catnip: num  1 0 1 1
```

- Here the `str()` function tells us that `cats` and `cats2` are both `data.frame`s - a very common kind of data structure in `R`
  - All data frames are composed of rows and columns.
  - Every column has the same number of rows
  - Every column has one and only one data type
  - Each column can be a different data type

- To understand `data.frame`s, a bit better, let's meet a different data structure called a _vector_

----------

## Vectors

- These are the **MOST COMMON DATA STRUCTURE**
  - Vectors are an ordered collection of data values
  - Vectors can contain **ONLY A SINGLE DATA TYPE** (*atomic vectors*)

- **INTERACTIVE DEMO**

- Let's define an **ATOMIC VECTOR OF NUMBERS**
  - To create a vector **USE THE `c()` FUNCTION** (`c()` is `combine`; use `?c`)

```R
> x <- c(10, 12, 45, 33)
> x
[1] 10 12 45 33
```

- Let's check the data type, and what kind of structure we have

```R
> typeof(x)
[1] "double"
> length(x)
[1] 4
> str(x)
 num [1:4] 10 12 45 33
```

- This is a little cryptic as output
  - We can see from `typeof()` that the vector contains the `double` type
  - The output of `str()` tells us:
    - it's a `numeric` (`num`) vector - which includes `double` and `integer` datatypes
    - there are four elements `[1:4]` in the vector
    - the first few datapoint in the vector

- `str()` tells us that the `cats$coat` column is a vector, too:

```R
> str(cats$coat)
 chr [1:3] "calico" "black" "tabby"
```

----------

## Coercion (1)

- **INTERACTIVE DEMO**

- Given what we've done so far, what do you think the following will produce when we use `typeof()`?
  - **PAUSE FOR STUDENT SUGGESTIONS**

```R
> quiz_vector <- c(2,6,'3')
> typeof(quiz_vector)
[1] "character"
```

- Here, `R` has enforced that the type of the vector is `character` (string), because we can always represent numbers as strings, but we can't always represent strings as numbers

- **PAUSE: NEXT CALLOUTS**
- This is called _type coercion_ and can cause surprises in your code
  - It is a key reason why you need to be aware of the basic data types and how `R` interprets them.

- **INTERACTIVE DEMO**

- Consider these two vectors

```R
> coercion_vector <- c('a', TRUE)
> coercion_vector
[1] "a"    "TRUE"
> another_coercion_vector <- c(0, TRUE)
> another_coercion_vector
[1] 0 1
```

- What do you expect their datatypes to be?

```R
> typeof(coercion_vector)
[1] "character"
> typeof(another_coercion_vector)
[1] "double"
```

----------

## Coercion (2)

- *Coercion* is what happens when you **CONVERT ONE DATA TYPE INTO ANOTHER**
- If `R` thinks it needs to, it will **COERCE DATA IMPLICITLY** without telling you
- There is a set order for coercion
  - `logical` can be coerced to `integer`, but `integer` cannot be coerced to `logical`
  - That's because `integer` can describe all `logical` values, but not *vice versa*
  - Everything can be represented as a `character`, so that's the fallback position for `R`
- **IF THERE'S A FORMATTING PROBLEM IN YOUR DATA, `R` MIGHT CONVERT THE TYPE TO COPE**
  - `R` will choose the simplest data type that can represent all items in the vector

- **INTERACTIVE DEMO IN CONSOLE** More useful things to do with vectors
- You can (usually) **COERCE VECTORS MANUALLY** with `as.<type>()`

```R
> x
[1] 10 12 45 33
> as.character(x)
[1] "10" "12" "45" "33"
> as.complex(x)
[1] 10+0i 12+0i 45+0i 33+0i
> as.logical(x)
[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
```

- Surprising things can happen when `R` forces one data type into another.
- **If your data doesn't look how you expect it to, _type coercion_ may be to blame**
  - Check your data formatting (is there an accidental string/character?)

- Let's look at our `cats` dataframe again
  
```R
> cats
    coat weight likes_catnip
1 calico    2.1            1
2  black    5.0            0
3  tabby    3.2            1
> typeof(cats$likes_catnip)
[1] "integer"
```

- The type of the `likes_catnip` column is recorded as an integer, but we want `logical` `TRUE`/`FALSE` values.
  - We can use the `as.logical()` function to change this

```R
> cats$likes_catnip <- as.logical(cats$likes_catnip)
> cats
    coat weight likes_catnip
1 calico    2.1         TRUE
2  black    5.0        FALSE
3  tabby    3.2         TRUE
> str(cats)
'data.frame': 3 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ coat        : chr  "calico" "black" "tabby"
 $ weight      : num  2.1 5 3.2
 $ likes_catnip: logi  TRUE FALSE TRUE
```

----------

## Lists

- `list`s are data structures like *vectors*, **EXCEPT THEY CAN HOLD ANY DATA TYPE**
  - They are not constrained to atomic types
  - They do not coerce their contents' datatypes

- Let's create a new list using the `list()` function

```R
> l <- list(1, 'a', TRUE, seq(2, 5))
> length(l)
[1] 4
> l
[[1]]
[1] 1

[[2]]
[1] "a"

[[3]]
[1] TRUE

[[4]]
[1] 2 3 4 5
```

- Individual elements in the list are identified with **DOUBLE SQUARE BRACKETS**
  - There are four elements
  - `[[1]]` is the number `1`
  - `[[2]]` is the character `"a"`
  - `[[3]]` is the logical value `TRUE`
  - `[[4]]` is the vector of values from 2 to 5
- We can extract a single element from the list with the double square bracket notation

```R
> l[[1]]
[1] 1
> l[[4]]
[1] 2 3 4 5
```

- Using the `str()` function we can see the datatypes of all the elements in the list

```R
> str(l)
List of 4
 $ : num 1
 $ : chr "a"
 $ : logi TRUE
 $ : int [1:4] 2 3 4 5
```

- **The elements of a list can also have names**
  - We specify the name when we create the list

```R
> l_named <- list(a = "SWC", b = 1:4)
> l_named
$a
[1] "SWC"

$b
[1] 1 2 3 4
```

- We can use the name of each element to retrieve it, with the `$` notation:

```R
> l_named$a
[1] "SWC"
> l_named$b
[1] 1 2 3 4
```

- But it's still a list like any other, and we can use the double square bracket notation.

```R
> l_named[[1]]
[1] "SWC"
> l_named[[2]]
[1] 1 2 3 4
> str(l_named)
List of 2
 $ a: chr "SWC"
 $ b: int [1:4] 1 2 3 4
```

----------

## Let's Look At A Data Frame

- We didn't go into detail about the `cats` dataframe we created at the start of this episode.
  - But let's look at it more closely

```R
> cats
    coat weight likes_catnip
1 calico    2.1         TRUE
2  black    5.0        FALSE
3  tabby    3.2         TRUE
> typeof(cats)
[1] "list"
> cats[[2]]
[1] 2.1 5.0 3.2
> typeof(cats$weight)
[1] "double"
```

- So `cats` is a `list`, and each element in the list is a vector

- **PAUSE: NEXT CALLOUT**
- But `cats` is a **special kind of list** - a `data.frame` - where all the vectors have the same length.
  - We can see that this is a special kind of list by using the `class()` function

```R
> class(cats)
[1] "data.frame"
> class(l)
[1] "list"
```

- The class `data.frame` represents a standard way of organising data:
  - Each _row_ is an observation
  - Each _column_ is a variable
  - The data frame represents a series of observations

----------

## Load Episode Data

- **DEMO IN SCRIPT**
- **DOWNLOAD DATA**
  - Use the link from the Etherpad document
  - Place the file in `data/`
- **CREATE A NEW SCRIPT**
  - Call it `gapminder`
  - Add the code
  - Use `read.table`
  - The data is in CSV format
  - We need to provide a data source (**here, a file**), the separator character, and whether there's a header row

```R
# Load gapminder data from a local file
gapminder <- read.table("data/gapminder_data.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE)
```

- **RUN THE SCRIPT** (use `Source`)
- **CHECK THE DATA IN THE `Environment` TAB**
  - Click on `gapminder` in `Environment` tab.
  - **NOTE COLUMNS**

----------

## Investigating `gapminder`

- Now we've loaded our data, let's take a look at it
- **DEMO IN CONSOLE**
  - 1704 rows, 6 columns
  - Investigate types of columns
  - **POINT OUT THAT THE TYPE OF A COLUMN IS INTEGER IF IT'S A FACTOR**
  - **LENGTH OF A DATAFRAME IS THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS**

- It's always useful to get an initial understanding of your data with the `str()` function.

```R
> str(gapminder)
'data.frame': 1704 obs. of  6 variables:
 $ country  : Factor w/ 142 levels "Afghanistan",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ year     : int  1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 ...
 $ pop      : num  8425333 9240934 10267083 11537966 13079460 ...
 $ continent: Factor w/ 5 levels "Africa","Americas",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
 $ lifeExp  : num  28.8 30.3 32 34 36.1 ...
 $ gdpPercap: num  779 821 853 836 740 ...
```

- The `summary()` function can also be useful
  - With dataframes, this gives a numeric, tabular, or descriptive summary of each column.

```R
> summary(gapminder)
        country          year           pop               continent      lifeExp
 Afghanistan:  12   Min.   :1952   Min.   :6.001e+04   Africa  :624   Min.   :23.60
 Albania    :  12   1st Qu.:1966   1st Qu.:2.794e+06   Americas:300   1st Qu.:48.20
 Algeria    :  12   Median :1980   Median :7.024e+06   Asia    :396   Median :60.71
 Angola     :  12   Mean   :1980   Mean   :2.960e+07   Europe  :360   Mean   :59.47
 Argentina  :  12   3rd Qu.:1993   3rd Qu.:1.959e+07   Oceania : 24   3rd Qu.:70.85
 Australia  :  12   Max.   :2007   Max.   :1.319e+09                  Max.   :82.60
 (Other)    :1632
   gdpPercap
 Min.   :   241.2
 1st Qu.:  1202.1
 Median :  3531.8
 Mean   :  7215.3
 3rd Qu.:  9325.5
 Max.   :113523.1
```

- We can also inspect individual columns of the data.

```R
> typeof(gapminder$year)
[1] "integer"
> typeof(gapminder$country)
[1] "integer"
```

- This looks a little weird: why should the country be an integer?
  - Let's investigate further with `str()`

```R
> str(gapminder$country)
 Factor w/ 142 levels "Afghanistan",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
```

- The `country` column has been read in as a `factor`
  - A `factor` is a data structure that represents _categorical_ data.
  - We can see this in the `str()` output we got, as well: both `country` and `continent` were read in as factors.
  - This is fine, and is what we actually want.

- We can ask about the dimensions of the dataframe with `dim()`

```R
> dim(gapminder)
[1] 1704    6
```

- So there are 1704 rows and 6 columns
- What does `length()` produce:

```R
> length(gapminder)
[1] 6
```

- Remember that a dataframe is a `list` of `vector` columns, so its length is the number of elements in the list.
  - There are six columns, so the length of the dataframe is 6.

- We can ask specifically for the number of rows and columns, and for other information.
- We can also use `head()` to summarise the dataframe.

```R
> nrow(gapminder)
[1] 1704
> ncol(gapminder)
[1] 6
> colnames(gapminder)
[1] "country"   "year"      "pop"       "continent" "lifeExp"   "gdpPercap"
> head(gapminder)
      country year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
1 Afghanistan 1952  8425333      Asia  28.801  779.4453
2 Afghanistan 1957  9240934      Asia  30.332  820.8530
3 Afghanistan 1962 10267083      Asia  31.997  853.1007
4 Afghanistan 1967 11537966      Asia  34.020  836.1971
5 Afghanistan 1972 13079460      Asia  36.088  739.9811
```

## Data Frame Manipulation With `dplyr`

----------

## Learning Objectives (Data Frames)

- You're going to **learn to manipulate `data.frame`s with the six *verbs* of `dplyr`**

- `select()`
- `filter()`
- `group_by()`
- `summarize()`
- `mutate()`
- `%>%` (pipe)

----------

## What and Why is `dplyr`?

- `dplyr` is a package in the **TIDYVERSE**; it exists to enable **rapid analysis of data by groups**
  - For example, if we wanted numerical (rather than graphical) analysis of the `gapminder` data by continent, we'd use `dplyr`
  - It enables group-level analyses without using repetitive code

- **AVOIDING REPETITION IMPROVES YOUR CODE**
  - More **robust**
  - More **readable**
  - More **reproducible**

----------

## Split-Apply-Combine

- The **general principle** `dplyr` supports is called **SPLIT-APPLY-COMBINE**

- We have a **dataset with several groups in a variable** (column `x`)
  - For example, each patient in our messy data might be a "group"
- We **want to perform the same operation on each group, independently** - take a mean of `y` for each group, for example
  - So we **SPLIT** the data into groups, on `x`
  - Then we **APPLY** the operation (take the mean for each group)
  - Then we **COMBINE** the results into a new table

----------

## `select()` - Interactive Demo**

- **DEMO IN CONSOLE**
  - Import `dplyr`

```R
> library(dplyr)
```

- The `select()` *verb* **SELECTS COLUMNS**
  - **DEMO IN CONSOLE**
  - If we wanted to select only year, country and GDP data from `gapminder`
  - Specify: **data, then columns**

```R
> head(select(gapminder, year, country, gdpPercap))
  year     country gdpPercap
1 1952 Afghanistan  779.4453
2 1957 Afghanistan  820.8530
3 1962 Afghanistan  853.1007
4 1967 Afghanistan  836.1971
5 1972 Afghanistan  739.9811
6 1977 Afghanistan  786.1134
```

- Here, we **applied a function**, but we can also **'PIPE' DATA FROM ONE VERB TO ANOTHER**
  - These work **like pipes in the shell**
  - **SPECIAL PIPE SYMBOL: `%>%`**
  - Specify **only columns**

```R
> gapminder %>% select(year, country, gdpPercap) %>% head()
  year     country gdpPercap
1 1952 Afghanistan  779.4453
2 1957 Afghanistan  820.8530
3 1962 Afghanistan  853.1007
4 1967 Afghanistan  836.1971
5 1972 Afghanistan  739.9811
6 1977 Afghanistan  786.1134
```

## `filter()`

- `filter()` selects rows on the basis of some condition, or combination of conditions
  - We can **use it as a function, with *pipes***

- **DEMO IN CONSOLE**

```R
> head(filter(gapminder, continent=="Europe"))
  country year     pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
1 Albania 1952 1282697    Europe   55.23  1601.056
2 Albania 1957 1476505    Europe   59.28  1942.284
3 Albania 1962 1728137    Europe   64.82  2312.889
4 Albania 1967 1984060    Europe   66.22  2760.197
5 Albania 1972 2263554    Europe   67.69  3313.422
6 Albania 1977 2509048    Europe   68.93  3533.004
```

- **DEMO IN SCRIPT** (`gapminder.R`)
  - One **advantage of pipes** is that they make chaining *verbs* together **MORE READABLE**
  - **END THE LINES WITH THE PIPE SYMBOL** so `R` knows that there's a continuation
  - `Run` the lines and **check the output** in `Environment`

```R
# Select gdpPercap by country and year, only for Europe
eurodata <- gapminder %>%
              filter(continent == "Europe") %>%
              select(year, country, gdpPercap)
```

----------

## Challenge

```R
# Select life expectancy by country and year, only for Africa
> afrodata <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Africa") %>%
  select(year, country, lifeExp)
> nrow(afrodata)
[1] 624
```

## `group_by()`

- The `group_by()` *verb* **SPLITS `data.frame`s INTO GROUPS ON A VARIABLE/COLUMN PROPERTY**
- **DEMO IN CONSOLE**
  - It returns a **`tibble`** - a table with extra metadata describing the groups in the table

```R
> group_by(gapminder, continent)
# A tibble: 1,704 x 6
# Groups:   continent [5]
       country  year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
        <fctr> <int>    <dbl>    <fctr>   <dbl>     <dbl>
 1 Afghanistan  1952  8425333      Asia  28.801  779.4453
 2 Afghanistan  1957  9240934      Asia  30.332  820.8530
 3 Afghanistan  1962 10267083      Asia  31.997  853.1007
 4 Afghanistan  1967 11537966      Asia  34.020  836.1971
 5 Afghanistan  1972 13079460      Asia  36.088  739.9811
 6 Afghanistan  1977 14880372      Asia  38.438  786.1134
 7 Afghanistan  1982 12881816      Asia  39.854  978.0114
 8 Afghanistan  1987 13867957      Asia  40.822  852.3959
 9 Afghanistan  1992 16317921      Asia  41.674  649.3414
10 Afghanistan  1997 22227415      Asia  41.763  635.3414
# ... with 1,694 more rows
```

----------

## `summarize()`

- The **combination of `group_by()` and `summarize()` is very powerful**
  - We can **CREATE NEW VARIABLES** using functions that repeat for each group
- Here, we've split the original table into three groups, and now **CREATE A NEW VARIABLE `mean_b` THAT IS FILLED BY CALCULATING THE MEAN OF `b`**

- **DEMO IN SCRIPT**
  - We use the same principle to **calculate mean GDP per continent**

```R
> # Produce table of mean GDP by continent
> gapminder %>%
+     group_by(continent) %>%
+     summarize(meangdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap))
# A tibble: 5 x 2
  continent meangdpPercap
     <fctr>         <dbl>
1    Africa      2193.755
2  Americas      7136.110
3      Asia      7902.150
4    Europe     14469.476
5   Oceania     18621.609
```

----------

## Challenge 13

- **IN THE SCRIPT**

```R
# Find average life expectancy by nation
avg_lifexp_country <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(meanlifeExp=mean(lifeExp))
```

- **IN THE CONSOLE**

```R
> avg_lifexp_country %>% filter(meanlifeExp == min(meanlifeExp))
# A tibble: 1 × 2
  country      meanlifeExp
  <chr>              <dbl>
1 Sierra Leone        36.8
> avg_lifexp_country %>% filter(meanlifeExp == max(meanlifeExp))
# A tibble: 1 × 2
  country meanlifeExp
  <chr>         <dbl>
1 Iceland        76.5
```

![](images/red_green_sticky.png)

----------

## `count()` and `n()`

- Two other useful functions are related to `summarize()`
  - **`count()` reports a new table of counts by group**
  - **`n()` is used to represent the count of rows, when calculating new values in `summarize()`**
- **DEMO IN CONSOLE**

- **NOTE:** standard error is (std dev)/sqrt(n)

```R
> gapminder %>% filter(year == 2002) %>% count(continent, sort = TRUE)
# A tibble: 5 x 2
  continent     n
     <fctr> <int>
1    Africa    52
2      Asia    33
3    Europe    30
4  Americas    25
5   Oceania     2
> gapminder %>% group_by(continent) %>% summarize(se_lifeExp = sd(lifeExp)/sqrt(n()))
# A tibble: 5 x 2
  continent se_lifeExp
     <fctr>      <dbl>
1    Africa  0.3663016
2  Americas  0.5395389
3      Asia  0.5962151
4    Europe  0.2863536
5   Oceania  0.7747759
```

----------

## `mutate()`

- **`mutate()` CALCULATES NEW VARIABLES (COLUMNS) ON THE BASIS OF EXISTING COLUMNS**
- **DEMO IN SCRIPT**
  - Say we want to calculate the **total GDP of each nation, each year, in $bn**
  - We'd multiply the GDP per capita by the total population, and divide by 1bn
- **INSPECT THE OUTPUT**
  - We have a new data table, which is the `gapminder` data, plus an extra column

```R
# Calculate GDP in $billion
gdp_bill <- gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdp_billion = gdpPercap * pop / 10^9)
```

- **WE CAN CHAIN ALL THESE OPERATIONS TOGETHER WITH PIPES**
- **We can calculate several summaries in a single `summarize()` command**
- We can use the output of `mutate()` in the `summarize()` command
- **DEMO IN SCRIPT**
  - We're going to calculate the **total (and standard deviation) of GDP per continent, per year**
  - Calculate total GDP first
  - Group by continent and year
  - Summarise mean and sd of GDP per capita, and total GDP

- **INSPECT THE OUTPUT**

```R
# Calculate total/sd of GDP by continent and year
gdp_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdp_billion=gdpPercap*pop/10^9) %>%
  group_by(continent,year) %>%
  summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap),
            sd_gdpPercap=sd(gdpPercap),
            mean_gdp_billion=mean(gdp_billion),
            sd_gdp_billion=sd(gdp_billion))
```

----------

## `ifelse()`

- **`ifelse()` IS A FILTER THAT CAN BE USED WITH MUTATE TO CALCULATES NEW VARIABLES (COLUMNS) ON THE BASIS OF EXISTING COLUMNS ONLY IF SOME CONDITION IS MET**
- **DEMO IN SCRIPT**
  - Say we want to calculate the total GDP of each nation, each year, in $bn **BUT ONLY FOR COUNTRIES OVER 10mn PEOPLE**

```R
gdp_billion_large_countries <- gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdp_billion_large = ifelse(pop > 10e6, 
                                    gdpPercap * pop / 10^9,
                                    NA))
```

- **INSPECT THE OUTPUT**
  - We have a new data table, which is the `gapminder` data, plus an extra column

- Similarly, we can scale GDP only in those cases where life expectancy for a nation is over 40

```R
gdp_future_bycontinents_byyear_high_lifeExp <- gapminder %>%
    mutate(gdp_futureExpectation = ifelse(lifeExp > 40, gdpPercap * 1.5, gdpPercap)) %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              mean_gdpPercap_expected = mean(gdp_futureExpectation))
```

## Tidy Data

----------

## Why Tidy Data?

- Data cleaning/processing is **not just a first step** - it must be repeated many time over the course of an analysis
  - new data, new ideas, etc. turn up as you're working
- About **80% of the effort of data analysis** is cleaning and preparing data for analysis

- The principles of **tidy data** provide a standard way to organise data values within a dataset
  - "Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way"

----------

## An Untidy Dataset (1)

- Here's a dataset like you might receive it from a colleague

- It's a **RECTANGULAR TABLE**
  - Made up of **ROWS** and **COLUMNS**, just like the data you've been working with

- Each row describes a treatment
- Each column gives the results for a different individual, for each treatment

- Thinking about how our dataframes are structured, there should be one row per observation.
  - But here the observations are the people
  - So maybe we could transpose the rows and columns so that the people are the rows?

----------

## An Untidy Dataset (2)

- So we've transposed the rows and columns of the table
- The **data is the same**
- The **layout is different**

- Now we have one row per observation, and we have one column per variable (treatments A and B), and that's what we want, isn't it?

- **PAUSE: NEW CALLOUT**
- But the data doesn't have to be structured this way.
  - In fact, this isn't a very good way to structure data for many analyses.

- To understand what this means, **AND WHY IT IS UNTIDY DATA**, we need to consider some data semantics.

----------

## Data Semantics

- We need to define three terms

- A dataset, like the one shown, is a collection of **VALUES**

- Each value belongs to a variable, and to an observation
- A **VARIABLE** is something that *can change or vary*
  - They may be values that measure the same underlying attribute, such as height, temperature, or some kind of output result
  - They may be experimental conditions under a researcher's control, such as a treatment, how long that treatment is applied, or other experimental settings
- An **OBSERVATION** is a collection of **values** measured across all **variables** for the same individual or unit
  - The unit is often a person, a collective group like a religion or company, or a physical item like a reactor vessel

----------

## Challenge (2min)

- So for our first messy dataset, how would you describe the rows and columns of the table?
  - Are they observations, or variables, or neither?

- **THE ROWS AND COLUMNS IN THE MESSY DATA ARE NEITHER OBSERVATIONS NOR VARIABLES**

----------

## A Tidy Dataset (1)

- The dataset contains 18 values:
  - six observations of three variables

- The variables are:
  - **PERSON**: John, Mary and Jane
  - **TREATMENT**: A or B
  - **RESULT**: `NA`, 16, 3, 2, 11, 1

- Each **OBSERVATION** includes values for all three variables

----------

## A Tidy Dataset (2)

- Here is the dataset represented in tidy form

- You can see each variable has its own column
- Each observation has one value per column
  - **Note: Missing data counts as a value**

----------

## Tidy Data (2)

- Tidy data is a **STANDARD** way of structuring a dataset, but it is not the only way, or always the best way
  - It does make it easy to extract the variables you need
  - It is also very well suited to `R` because it supports vectorisation (which you saw earlier)

- In Tidy Data:
  - Each variable forms a column
  - Each observation forms a row

- Most of the data you receive is unlikely to be Tidy, so you'll probably need to clean it
- And **MESSY DATA CAN BE USEFUL**
  - If your design is completely crossed: e.g. every individual tries every medicine
    - Messy Data (rows=patients, columns=medicines) is compact
      - Also useful if matrix operations are appropriate

- **INTERACTIVE DEMO**
  - Show that the `gapminder` data is in an intermediate format
  - Three ID variables (continent, country, year)
  - Three observation variables (pop, lifeExp, gdpPercap)
  - This intermediate form can be preferable; there is no advantage to having a single "observation" column, here
  
- **IN THE CONSOLE**
  - Each column in the `gapminder` dataset is a variable
  - Each row is a set of values: one per variable, comprising a single observation for a combination of country and year
- **WE CAN USE DPLYR DATA METHODS ON THIS DATASET**

```r
> head(gapminder)
      country year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
1 Afghanistan 1952  8425333      Asia  28.801  779.4453
2 Afghanistan 1957  9240934      Asia  30.332  820.8530
3 Afghanistan 1962 10267083      Asia  31.997  853.1007
4 Afghanistan 1967 11537966      Asia  34.020  836.1971
5 Afghanistan 1972 13079460      Asia  36.088  739.9811
6 Afghanistan 1977 14880372      Asia  38.438  786.1134
```

----------

## Long v Wide

- We often refer to datasets as being "long" or "wide"
- **LONG datasets have one row per observation, and one column per variable**
- **WIDE datasets might have multiple arrangements**

- Wide datasets tend to be easier for humans to read
  - Quite a lot of the time, we tend to record and share datasets in wide format.
- **BUT MANY R FUNCTIONS ARE DESIGNED TO WORK WITH LONG DATA**
  - Some plotting functions work better with wide data, though
  - The purely long format can require additional grouping operations (like `group_by()`), and it can be more convenient to have an intermediate form like the `gapminder` data.

----------

## `gapminder` Wide Dataset

- We've been using the nicely-formatted `gapminder` data to make our lives easier.
- **THE DATA YOU RECEIVE IN A RESEARCH CONTEXT WILL NOT USUALLY BE SO NICELY-FORMATTED**
- Let's load in the wide-format `gapminder` data and take a look at it.

```R

```

- **ALSO VIEW IN RSTUDIO**
- This is very wide data and it looks like it would be a bit of a nightmare to do the kinds of analyses we have been doing, with the data in this format.

----------

## Pivot: Wide to Long

- We want to convert this wide format that's difficult to work with to our nice, longer, intermediate layout.
- **TO DO THIS WE USE THE `pivot_longer()` FUNCTION FROM `dplyr`/`tidyverse`**
  - This makes datasets longer by increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns
  - You may be familiar with "pivot tables" from Excel, which are similar.

- It works like the image shows
  - We define the dataset we want to pivot
  - We say which columns we want to convert from wide to long format in the `cols` variable
    - The `pivot_longer()` function effectively splits the table by these columns
    - The column name then gets converted to its own, new column, but the values are kept
  - We specify the names of the new "name" and "value" columns wiht `names_to` and `values_to`.

- For the `gapminder` data, we want to pivot all columns that start with `pop`, `lifeExp` or `gdpPercent`
  - We'll put the column names into a column called `obstype_year`
  - We'll put the values into a column called `obs_values`

```R
> gap_long <- gap_wide %>%
+     pivot_longer(
+         cols = c(starts_with('pop'), starts_with('lifeExp'), starts_with('gdpPercap')),
+         names_to = "obstype_year", values_to = "obs_values"
+     )
> str(gap_long)
tibble [5,112 × 4] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
 $ continent   : chr [1:5112] "Africa" "Africa" "Africa" "Africa" ...
 $ country     : chr [1:5112] "Algeria" "Algeria" "Algeria" "Algeria" ...
 $ obstype_year: chr [1:5112] "pop_1952" "pop_1957" "pop_1962" "pop_1967" ...
 $ obs_values  : num [1:5112] 9279525 10270856 11000948 12760499 14760787 ...
```

- This gives us a long format table with four columns
- **BUT IT'S NOT QUITE WHAT WE WANT, BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO KINDS OF DATA COMBINED IN THE `obstype_year` COLUMN**
  - We want to split `year` into its own column.

## `separate()`

- **THE `separate()` FUNCTION SPLITS THE CONTENTS OF A SINGLE COLUMN INTO MULTIPLE NEW COLUMNS**
  - We want to split the year information from every cell in the `obstype_year` column into its own new column.

- The `separate()` function needs to know:
  - dataframe it's working on
  - the column it's splitting
  - the names of the new columns it's making
  - the character it's splitting the cell content on

- We split the `obstype_year` column into two columns called `obs_type` and `year`, on the underscore separator `"_"`.

```R
> gap_long <- gap_long %>% separate(obstype_year, into = c('obs_type', 'year'), sep = "_")
```

- As the year at this point is still a character string, we change the datatype with `as.integer` and take a look at the new dataframe.

```R
> gap_long$year <- as.integer(gap_long$year)
> str(gap_long)
tibble [5,112 × 5] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)

- **THIS IS STILL NOT QUITE WHERE WE WANT IT**
  - There are three types of observation combined in `obs_type` and `obs_values` and it would be convenient to split them into new columns

----------

## Pivot: Long to Wide

- We want to convert this long format into a slightly wider intermediate layout, for convenience.
- There is a companion function to `pivot_longer()` called `pivot_wider()` that we use for this.
  - It's essentially the reverse of `pivot_longer()`

- **THE `pivot_wider()` FUNCTION SPLITS THE TABLE UP BY VALUES IN THE COLUMN OF "NAMES"**
  - It then changes the name of the "VALUES" column to reflect the value in the "NAMES" column for each split.
  - Finally, it recombines the columns into a single table on the basis of the ID columns

- We want to do this with the `gapminder` data by using the `obs_type` column for the names, and the `obs_values` column for the values.

```R
> gap_normal <- gap_long %>% pivot_wider(names_from = obs_type, values_from = obs_values)
> str(gap_normal)
tibble [1,704 × 6] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
 $ continent: chr [1:1704] "Africa" "Africa" "Africa" "Africa" ...
 $ country  : chr [1:1704] "Algeria" "Algeria" "Algeria" "Algeria" ...
 $ year     : int [1:1704] 1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 ...
 $ pop      : num [1:1704] 9279525 10270856 11000948 12760499 14760787 ...
 $ lifeExp  : num [1:1704] 43.1 45.7 48.3 51.4 54.5 ...
 $ gdpPercap: num [1:1704] 2449 3014 2551 3247 4183 ...
```

- And we can see that this has restored the intermediate form of the data that was so useful to us earlier.

----------

## Challenge (5min)

- Using gap_long, calculate the mean life expectancy, population, and gdpPercap for each continent. Hint: use the group_by() and summarize() functions we learned in the dplyr lesson

```R
gap_long %>% group_by(continent, obs_type) %>%
   summarize(means=mean(obs_values))
```
